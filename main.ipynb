Detecting sarcasm in text is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it often depends on subtle linguistic cues and contextual knowledge. \n","        In this project, we aim to build a robust <strong>binary classification model</strong> that can predict whether a given news headline is sarcastic (<code>1</code>) or not (<code>0</code>).\n","    </p>\n","\n"," <h2 style=\"color:#ffd700;\">üéØ Motivation</h2>\n","    <p>\n","        Understanding sarcasm is essential for improving sentiment analysis, conversational AI systems, and human-computer interaction. \n","        Misinterpreting sarcasm can lead to inaccurate sentiment scores or inappropriate responses in automated systems such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or recommendation models.\n","    </p>\n","\n","<h2 style=\"color:#ffd700;\">üõ† Project Steps</h2>\n","    <ol>\n","        <li><strong>Data Loading & Exploration</strong> ‚Äì Import the dataset, inspect key features, and check distribution of classes.</li>\n","        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong> ‚Äì Tokenize text, remove unwanted characters, apply lemmatization, and handle stopwords.</li>\n","        <li><strong>Feature Representation</strong> ‚Äì Use methods like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings to convert text into numerical vectors.</li>\n","        <li><strong>Model Selection & Training</strong> ‚Äì Train classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, Transformers).</li>\n","        <li><strong>Evaluation</strong> ‚Äì Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to assess performance.</li>\n","        <li><strong>Explainability</strong> ‚Äì Apply techniques like SHAP or LIME to interpret model predictions.</li>\n","        <li><strong>Insights & Conclusion</strong> ‚Äì Summarize findings, challenges, and possible improvements.</li>\n","    </ol>\n","\n","<h2 style=\"color:#ffd700;\">üìÇ Dataset Overview</h2>\n","    <p>\n","        The dataset contains approximately <strong>26,000 headlines</strong> collected from news sources.
